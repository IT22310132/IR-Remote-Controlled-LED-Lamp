# IR Remote Controlled LED Lamp â€“ Arduino Project

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a remote-controlled LED lamp using an **Arduino UNO R3** and a **standard IR remote**. The lamp includes four white LEDs and a single RGB LED, enabling customizable lighting effects, brightness control, and color sequencing through button presses on the remote.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- IR-based remote control interface using a standard TV remote
- Control of 4 white LEDs and 1 RGB LED
- Brightness adjustment using volume up/down buttons
- Sequential lighting of LEDs using channel up/down buttons
- Multiple RGB color modes (solid and combinations)
- Fully implemented in C using Microchip Studio
- Finalized circuit on a dot board after testing on breadboard

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Arduino UNO R3
- IR Remote + IR Receiver module
- RGB and White LEDs
- 220-ohm resistors
- Microchip Studio (Arduino C++)
- Tinkercad (for circuit simulation)

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Overview

- White LEDs are connected to PWM pins and controlled for brightness and sequencing.
- RGB LED allows multiple color combinations (e.g., red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, magenta, white).
- IR receiver decodes remote signals and maps them to corresponding lighting actions.
- Circuit tested on breadboard and finalized on dot board with proper soldering.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To explore embedded systems by integrating hardware components with programmable control logic, and to develop a practical, interactive lighting system using a familiar remote-control interface.

## ðŸ“¸ Highlights

- Breadboard prototype
- Dot board final circuit
- Code implemented and debugged using Microchip Studio
- Fully functioning remote-controlled LED lamp
